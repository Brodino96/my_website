        Hi! My name is Vincent, I am a passionate sound engineer, amateur programmer and lover of all things video games and cinema.<br>
        In my work as a sound engineer I mainly deal with live events, such as conferences, and projects related to cinema. Among the most
        memorable experiences is the collaboration with the McDonald Foundation during a charity event that left me with a great memory.
        I approach each project with a single philosophy: treat it as if it were my own, aiming for perfection.<br>
        Programming was born from curiosity and my passion for video games. In my free time, I develop mods for games, useful applications and
        tools that simplify my daily life.
